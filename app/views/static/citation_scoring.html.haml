        Citations receive a 1-10 number reflecting their status on Convus.

      Hypotheses have the score of their highest status citation.

    %p
      This score reflects how well the citation supports Convuses intentions:

    %ul
      %Li
        Publicly accessible, readable by everyone
      %li
        Reviewed by experts from the applicable field of study
      %li
        results defined by evidence and outcomes
      %li
        Published by a trustworthy source

    %p
      The highest score articles are ones that have been peer reviewed prior to publication. Judging the quality of the peer review is difficult, but impact factor is an easily accessible proxy (#{hypothesis_link_to "supporting hypothesis", 2253}). For now, we're using the impact factor of the journal to sort publications into high, medium and low status.
